# exhaustivity

Investigating the extent to which the QUD and/or a speaker's prior beliefs modulate exhaustivity inference of non-generic statements (i.e. "I had a salad for dinner last night")

## Research question: To what extent do prior beliefs and the locally determined QUD play a role in ad-hoc inference?

## Exhaustivity inference versus scalar implicature

Exhaustivity inference: "I had a salad for dinner" --> "I had a salad for dinner, and nothing else"
Scalar implicature: "I ate some of the cookies" --> "I ate some of the cookies, but not all of them"

Fundamental difference: The scale of operation is known a priori in case of a scalar implicature ("some" is almost always used in contexts referring to QUD of "how many?") but depends on the context for an exhaustivity inference ("I had [only] a salad" goes to the QUD of "What did you have for dinner?" which is derived only upon reading the sentence)

## Degen & Goodman (2014)

Found that manipulating the question under discussion (QUD) on the fly via cover stories induced scalar implicature, suggesting that pragmatic inference is sensitive to a changing QUD

## Stiller, Goodman, & Frank (2015)

Found that very young children do draw exhaustivity (or ad-hoc) inference, using visual displays differing in features in an attempt to derive "The friend wearing *only* glasses" from "Choose the friend wearing glasses" and a display where two "friends" wore glasses, but one wore something additional.

## Degen (2017)

Found that the Rational Speech Act Framework applied to "Black lives matter" showed a higher probability of "[Only] Black lives matter" assigned by speakers whose prior beliefs are that Black lives and white lives are regarded equally in society and thus inferred the QUD to be "Which lives matter?"

## Judith Tonhauser - multiple cues to the QUD (prosodic cues, information structure)
* Need to ensure that whatever's being done to the contexts are systematic enough that people can't aggress upon things like information structure

## Approach 1: Manipulating QUD via cover stories

Basic duality: Instead of "Who is smart" and "Are women smart?", could be "Did you have a salad for dinner" and "What did you have for dinner?"

What did you have for dinner: "Michelle is a young woman, and she is meeting her good friend to catch up. Soon after they greet each other, the two friends get to chatting about the details of their day. In the course of the conversation, Michelle says, 'I had a salad for dinner.' "

Did you have a salad for dinner: "Michelle is a young woman, and she is meeting her nutritionist to discuss her eating habits. In particular, the nutritionist is keen to know whether Michelle has been incorporating healthy elements in her meals. In the course of their meeting, Michelle says, 'I had a salad for dinner. "

Could ask participants (a la Frank et al.) to choose an image (of 3) that best represents Michelle's plate this evening (between an empty plate, a plate with salad on it, and a plate with salad and a baked potato on it).
* Could be confound with respect to visual simplicity
* Need to have large amount of fillers
* 1:1 what:did (10 each), 40 fillers

Could also ask: Did Michelle have anything else for dinner? (slide of Absolutely to Absolutely Not)

## Approach 2: Examining how prior beliefs come to bear

Maintain similar approach as (1), ask participants afterwards to rate on a slider if "Can one have a salad for dinner?" and the like

Could also replicate the experiment from Winter 2018 where stimuli like "I had a salad for dinner" are presented and a series of responses are given.

Important questions in this case:
* What are the possible responses in case of "I had a salad for dinner" ?
* Don't know if the possible responses are possible

## Approach 3: Applying RSA to non-generic statements
* What are the prior beliefs that come to bear on "I had a salad for dinner" ?
    * Thoughts: A relevant prior could be the extent to which a salad is a thing you *can* have for dinner
* Similar to Degen (2017): What are the different choices for prior beliefs given a non-generic statement inducing an ad-hoc inference, what is the highest probability QUD inferred given each level of prior belief (considering they are continuous, what is the distribution), and what is the highest probability meaning assigned to the utterance given the QUD?

## TBD: What will the other stimuli for these experiments look like?

## Brainstorm: If you ask participants to choose a likely response, what are the options?

Michelle: Hi, how are you?
Friend: I'm doing well. It's good to see you. How was your day today?
Michelle: Pretty uneventful. I had a salad for dinner.

Michelle: Hi, how are you?
Nutritionist: I'm well. I'm glad we're meeting to touch base on how well you've been incorporating healthy elements into your meals. How has that been going?
Michelle: Pretty uneventful. I had a salad for dinner.

Is it satisfying enough if John knows any of the good coffee places, or all of them? (depending on if you're getting coffee the one time, or if John is an acclaimed coffee critic and should know all of them)

## Prior probing stimuli
Question: how exactly to ask about it?
Other question: What should we be asking?
Third ques

Position your slider according to how likely you think the scenario

On one hand: How likely is someone to [eat only a salad for dinner] <--> [eat a salad and something else for dinner] (checking for prior beliefs on exhaustivity inference)

On the other: What does Michelle's friend want to know?
* What she had for dinner
* Whether she had a salad for dinner

## Experiments needed
1. Norming experiment for priors over critical statement stimuli:
* How likely is someone to [eat only a salad for dinner] <--> [eat a salad and something else for dinner]
2. Norming experiment for QUD manipulation over cover stories:
* Michelle is meeting a good friend this evening, whom she hasn't seen in a while. When they meet, they greet each other, and the friend asks her what she had for dinner.
* What does Michelle's friend want to know?
    * What Michelle had for dinner
    * If Michelle had only a salad for dinner
    * question: on a slider?
3. Did Michelle have anything else for dinner? Did Michelle only have salad for dinner? (probing the inference directly versus probing the lack of the inference)

what : polar
